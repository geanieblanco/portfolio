                <p class="lead">Every day over 750 million users log into Facebook, making it the most trafficked social networking website in the history of the Internet. Not having an effective social media plan means leaving out millions of potential customers, relationships,
                  and marketing opportunities. My social media approach consists of three important concepts: Voice, Content, and Execution.</p>

                <p><strong>Voice:</strong> Picking out a voice for your business is just as important as your physical appearance. Finding the essence of your business, whether it's mature and serious, young and funny, or something entirely its own, helps
                  to ensure that your brand is communicable to your targeted audience.</p>

                <p><strong>Content: </strong>Great content leads to great reactions. Keeping your business content clean, non-confrontational, and friendly will encourage readers to maintain connection to your business. </p>

                <p><strong>Execution: </strong>Knowing when to, or when not to post content makes sure that you're not overwhelming your audience, or not keeping them engaged enough. Having a publication schedule keeps the reader ready to find out what new
                  and exciting updates your brand has.</p>

              <div class="card-body" id="event-card">
                <p class="lead">Very rarely do people leave a website and think "That was a great experience"; those types of reactions are reserved for in-person interactions with people and product. Hosting a marketing event can do wonders for your business: it gives
                  you the chance to interact with your consumers creating a feeling or corporate trust between business and customer, it also gives the customer a chance to sample your work before committing. The worst type of bad experience is the one
                  that you had to pay for.</p>

                <p><strong>Creative Strategy: </strong>Marketing events generally take place as a vendor in a larger event, or as a stand alone pop-up event. During your event samples of your product or service are shown to the public by either your employees
                  or hired brand representatives. All aspects of the event from decor, to time of day are set to make sure your brand is shown in its natural form.</p>

                <p><strong>Execution: </strong>Focusing on the business's goal audience is vital to creating a good marketing event. Having a balloon-animal making clown at an event for a liquor store will not only leave your visitors confused, but can also
                  convey an irresponsible message. Keying into the needs and demographics of your audience makes sure that you represent your business in the best possible way.</p>

                <p class="lead">While event marketing is all about your customers, special events are all about you. Everyone needs time to sit back, relax with loved ones, and appreciate the hard work or milestones in your life. Special events are a way to make sure
                  that your work-life balance is keeping yourself and your employees sane and functioning.</p>
                <p><strong>Corporate: </strong>Whether it be a big meeting with a potential client or investor, an employee retreat, or a trip to that big industry conference in Vegas, corporate events are an entity all their own. I hope to coordinate an
                  event for you that is beneficial to your business, as well as memorable and fun. My services for corporate events include: meeting coordination, venue scouting, travel arrangements, catering, decorating, and operations.</p>

                <p><strong>Personal: </strong>Your life isn't all about business. Commemorate the big moments in life such a birthdays, Sweet 16's, holiday parties, and other milestones with a great event! Each event will be unique and catered (get it?)
                  to your every want and wish! My services for special events include, venue scouting, talent scouting, catering, decoration, lodging for out-of-town guests, and operations. At this current time I do not do weddings solo, but will be happy
                  to assist with bridal parties, bachelorette parties, and other pre/post-wedding celebrations.</p>
